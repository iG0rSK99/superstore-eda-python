# ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales EDA Project

This project explores the Superstore sales dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to extract key business insights, visualize patterns, and identify opportunities to improve profitability.

# ------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM STATEMENT -------------------------------------------------------

# The goal of analyzing the Superstore Sales Dataset is to explore the sales performance, understand customer purchasing behavior
# and identify factors that drive profitability.

# The dataset typically contains information about:

# Sales transactions (Order ID, Product, Category)
# Customer details (Customer ID, Region, Segment)
# Sales performance (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount)
# Shipping details (Ship Mode, Order Date, Ship Date)

# OBJECTIVE:

# To generate actionable insights that can help optimize inventory, improve profitability, and enhance customer targeting strategies.

# We've explored Superstore sales performance and identify insights that can improve profitability, marketing strategies and inventory management.

# ------------------------------------------------------- Key Insights -------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Sales & Profit Distribution

# Both Sales and Profit have extreme outliers, which were detected using the IQR method and boxplots.
# The dataset is right-skewed, with a few transactions significantly larger than the rest.

# 2. Top-Performing Sub-Categories

# Sub-categories like Chairs and Furnishing are highly profitable.
# Sub-categories such as Tables and Bookcases often result in losses, especially with high discounts.

# 3. Regional Insights

# The West region shows strong performance in both order volume and profitability.
# The South and East regions have lower average profit margins and Central regions are unprofitable.
# Top 3 states with contribution in sales and profit are Califonia, New York and Virginia.

# 4. Impact of Discounts

# Higher discounts generally lead to lower profits or losses.
# Discounts does not have any sifnificant impact on Sales.

# 5. Shipping Trends

# Standard Class is the most frequently used shipping mode across all regions.
# Same Day shipping is less common and typically used for smaller, urgent orders.
# Shipping mode choice does not directly impact profitability but may affect cost and delivery speed.

# 6. Visualization Highlights

# Boxplots plots were used for distribution analysis.
# Bar plots helped compare metrics like Sales, Profit, and Discount across Sub-Categories.
# Count plots and catplots provided clear views of Shipping Mode usage by Region.

# ------------------------------------------------------- Outlier Handling -------------------------------------------------------

# Outliers in Sales and Profit were identified using the IQR method and visualized using boxplots.

# -------------------------------------------------------  Conclusion -------------------------------------------------------

# This EDA provides actionable insights into product performance, discount strategies, and regional sales behavior. These findings can be used to:

# Optimize pricing and discount strategies
# Improve region-specific marketing
# Focus on profitable product categories
# Monitor and handle high-impact outliers
